If there was death around them, their dislike towards slaying would be weaker. The murder rate of our family town, Strych, is much lower than in most other towns. We have like one murder per year. Towns of equal size usually have about four murders per year. If it is a peaceful time, of course. That is why we punish felons severely and in hidden places."

Investigating a murder that happened in a dark street at night is usually a tough job and we often punish nobody because we cannot find which one of the suspects is guilty. Of course we sometimes execute innocents and release felons, but nobody is perfect."

The dungeons are quite impressive, the underground network of storages and tunnels is so large. Judging from the size of that dungeon, I think that he is using them as slaves for building a system of underground fortresses so that we could defend ourselves when enemies come for years. Like dwarves. Do you remember him having any servants there, sister? Have you learned something from them?"

Maybe they are those who were broken by the work and are too unfit for normal life. Disfigured, gimped,... Their life might be better than the lives of slaves and so they prefer it. Peasants work very hard all of their life, but they are free. These slaves work hard and are not free. I wonder what would is better, death or life without freedom. Maybe they are even given a choice. But keep on mind that these are just speculations, it might not be like that."

If you wanted to be rich, you might have kept the riches you have stolen, bought a tavern and get a share from its profits. You might have built another one for the earnings and earn faster. It would not have allowed you to live like a noble, but it would be a pleasant life. Anyone can enter the army and be paid enough to earn for a good living after a few years of service. Being poor is a choice. But it is the easier way."
